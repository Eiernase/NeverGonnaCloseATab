# Psychological Tab Manager
Psychological Tab Manager helps you Pavlov yourself into closing old tabs more often by playing amazing sounds and voicelines 
upon closing a tab that has been open and unused for a long time. 

It comes with an easy-to-use control panel featuring a funky, eye-catching design and options for customization, 
like changing the played sound and the timeout until it's triggered. 

The measurement for how long a tab has been open is saved between sessions! 
Because tabs mainly pile up when restoring last open tabs on the next launch. 

You can select from a pre-defined list of sounds to play or even upload your own!

# Installation
The Extension currently only works on chromium-based browsers supporting manifest v3.
## Google Chrome
Since Google Chrome does not allow for installing extensions which are not listed on the Chrome Web Store (and I don't have a credit card to pay 5$ to create a developer account), 
the extension needs to be installed as an unpacked extension with developer mode active: 

1. Download source code
2. Unpack
3. Go to chrome://extensions
4. Enable "Developer Mode"
5. Click on "Load unpacked"
6. Select source code folder
7. Enjoy

## Chromium
Download the .crx file from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Eiernase/NeverGonnaCloseATab/releases/) and drop it onto the browser or in some cases the extension page. 
You may need to enable "Developer Mode".

## Microsoft Edge
For Microsoft Edge the same procedure as for Google Chrome applies:

1. Download source code
2. Unpack
3. Go to edge://extensions
4. Enable "Developer Mode"
5. Click on "Load unpacked"
6. Select source code folder
7. Enjoy

## Operra GX

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Eiernase/NeverGonnaCloseATab/releases/) using Operra
2. It will tell you that the extension has been disabled 
3. Open the extension manager 
4. Click on "Install" 

I have submitted the extension to the Operra Web Store and it's pending for review, but their store seems to be unmoderated.

## Firefox
The version found in this repository is built for chromium-based browsers supporting Manifest v3. 
For Firefox, see [this repository](https://github.com/Eiernase/ThisTabIsOnFire/) instead.
